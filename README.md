This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# LAURA - FULL-STACK UI CHALLENGE

## Introduction

Welcome to LAURA's Full-Stack UI Challenge.

The primary goal of this exercise is to evaluate your ability to write well-defined HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the latest patterns and technologies in a mobile-first approach. There's no hard rules or tricky questions.

**We hope you have fun.**

If you are not a developer, you can have a look at our other opportunities at [laura-br.gupy.io](https://laura-br.gupy.io/)

## About Us

Laura is a Cognitive Robot Risk Manager that operates integrated with data environments to collect, organize and ultimately perform complex calculations, compare results with probabilistic ranges and accurately conclude whether or not conditions are favourable for a risk event occurs.

## About The Challenge

You will have 5 days to deliver this challenge, but be aware that we will more rigorously evaluate your code the longer it takes to deliver from the date this repository was forked.

For this exercise, you need to build a fast, responsive, mobile-first dashboard page. You will have to develop 2 screens (dashboard screen and login/signup screen) with fake data, following the layout below:

Also, you need to build a REST API that allows the users to sign up and authenticate using a JWT token. The data must be persisted into one of the following databases: PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

## Screens

The screen provided is the expected final design. However, you are expected to implement a user interface on the login/sign up screen and the responsiveness by yourself.

## Technology

Since the purpose of this exercise is to assess your HTML, CSS and JavaScript abilities, we discourage the use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Material UI but encourage the use of React or any other frontend framework.

## Bonus Points

- Documentation in code
- API documentation (e.g. Swagger)
- Small files with few responsibilities
- Use some preprocessor for your CSS, preferably SASS
- Get data from an API Generator (e.g. [JSON Generator](https://www.json-generator.com/))
- Follow some Javascript Style Guide
- Save user information in Local Storage
- Componentization
- Unit/Component Test
- Usage of Docker

## Review

After you delivered the completed assignment to us, we will review it as soon as we can. **We pay special attention to:**

- Coding skills

- - Writing understandable code
  - Whether you use HTML, JavaScript and CSS properly

- Software Engineering Skills

- - Code organization (modularity, dependencies between modules, naming, etc)

- Overall Feeling

- - Software usability
  - Assignment completion
  - Overall code quality (edge cases, usage of tools, performance, best practices)

## Ready to start the challenge?

- Fork this repository into your GitHub account
- Create a branch with your first and last name ex: `patrick-santos`
- After completing the challenge, create a pull request in this repository comparing your branch with the master
-  We will receive notification of your pull request, evaluate your solution, and contact the GitHub account email where the challenge was run
